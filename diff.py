Q1. What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
List
Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.
Lists are slower than tuples.
Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]

Tuples
Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
Tuples are faster than list.
Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)
